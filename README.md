left off on 2.3.4 Building an ISO Image
What was I doing again?
You just put together the "OS" which loads a single value into eax "CAFEBABE". 
you compiled this with NASM into an object file called loader.o
then you added a linker for it. called linker.ld
Finally you actually use your linker to make your OS an executable .elf file
Next time you've gotta build the iso file.
